### Hi there 👋, my name is Prem
I'm a developer advocate at RallyHealth
Having spent 8 years doing web development he’s seen it all, from browser wars, the rise of AJAX and the fall of 20 JavaScript frameworks (and that was just yesterday!). Always tinkering with something new he explores crazy ideas like writing your own implementation of cookie parser, creating IoC in JavaScript. When not sitting at a computer he can be found running while pushing his kids in a pram.

🔭 I’m currently working making the cloud easier to use
📣 I need to tweet things soon
