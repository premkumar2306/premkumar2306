### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Prem
I'm a developer advocate at RallyHealth
Having spent 8 years doing web development heâ€™s seen it all, from browser wars, the rise of AJAX and the fall of 20 JavaScript frameworks (and that was just yesterday!). Always tinkering with something new. When not sitting at a computer he can be found doing Yoga

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working making the cloud easier to use
ðŸ“£ I need to tweet things soon
